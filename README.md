Hi! Cheeseland is a 2D game in which a mouse has to collect four pieces of cheese to win the game.
I made this game through the Godot engine. 
I was a complete beginner before I made this game, and so of course there were many challenging parts, such as adjusting the background and the player's camera. However, as I continued creating and finishing the game, I felt quite satisfied about everything I learned from just making a simple game like this.
